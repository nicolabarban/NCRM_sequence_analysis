# Introduction to sequence analysis for social sciences
## 20-21 January 2022

## Summary
The course gives an introduction to the theoretical and practical concepts of sequence analysis for social sciences. Sequence analysis, originally developed in biology to analyse strings of DNA, has attracted increasing attention in the social sciences for the analysis of longitudinal data. Most applications in the social sciences study life course processes, such as labour market careers, educational careers, or family formation. During the short course, we will discuss the usefulness of sequence analysis in applied social sciences as a holistic approach to investigate timing, quantum and sequencing of life course events. We will consider the practical implementation of these methods using available data. Concepts covered include the statistical representations of categorical time series, measures of sequence dissimilarity (i.e., Optimal Matching Algorithm); patterns identification in life course trajectories; classification techniques; criticisms to sequence analysis and new developments.

## Computer software


* We will use RStudio and the Package **TraMineR**
* Those who are familiar with RStudio can  download the latest version of the package from CRAN. 
* Those who have **no previous experience with R** can follow the tutorial using RStudio Cloud (https://rstudio.cloud). Further instructions on how to use Rstudio cloud will be communicated at the beginning of the course.
